### How It Works

1. **Create Profiles**: Users add their favorite TV series.
2. **Start a Room**: One user creates a "watching room" and shares an invitation link.
3. **Get Recommendations**: The app analyzes the group's tastes and suggests 3-5 series with AI-powered justifications.

To run the project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/10x-series-matcher.git
    cd 10x-series-matcher
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    You will need to add your API keys to the `.env` file:

    ```sh
    # Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

    # Get your API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/
    TMDB_API_KEY="your-tmdb-api-key"
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Available Scripts

You can run the following scripts from the project root:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run start`: An alias for `npm run dev`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for errors.
